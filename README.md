# scroll-page-to-top
Web pages can be very long. This makes them really easy to view on tablets, but if the navigation isn't visible, it can make it difficult for visitors to return to the top of the page. Some Web templates have a 'back to top' button in the footer, but others don't. Visitors find it helpful to have a button that fades into view as you scroll down and floats along the bottom of the browser.

The "Scroll Page To Top" plugin allows users to smoothly scroll back to the top of the page. It's a little detail which enhances navigation experience on website with long pages.
